# Backup Resource

This resource enables users to create backups in a cluster.
Backups can be applied in 3 levels:

* Entire Cluster
* Selected Namespaces
* Resources Selection By Label Selector

For more information regarding cluster backup, see [Cluster Backup][cluster-backup].

    backup_ttl                   = "604800s"
    storage_location             = "TARGET_LOCATION_NAME"

    label_selector {
      match_expression {
        key      = "apps.tanzu.vmware.com/demo"
        operator = "Exists"
      }

      match_expression {

        operator = "DoesNotExist"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Import Backup
The resource ID for importing an existing backup should be comprised of a full cluster name and a backup name separated by '/'.

```bash
terraform import tanzu-mission-control_backup.demo_backup MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_NAME/PROVISIONER_NAME/CLUSTER_NAME/BACKUP_NAME
```
